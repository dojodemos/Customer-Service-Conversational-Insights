# Customer Service Conversational Insights

## Knowledge Mining applied to Conversations

Every day a large amount of data is generated by Customer Services in the form of Natural Language conversations with customers. This data is stored as chat logs (with human agents or bots) or audio recordings from voice-based calls.

This is typically unstructured data that, if processed, can result in a great amount of insights for Contact Centers, add additional data to NBA models and provide a better view of the customer.

The Customer Service Conversational Insights is a solution accelerator built on top of Azure Cognitive Search, Bot Framework, Azure Speech Services and Text Analytics that allows customers to quickly deploy an integrated platform and immediately start extracting insights from customer conversations.

# One click Azure Deployment
## Audio data
To deploy the full solution with audio files transcription and the Web Application, select the following button:

<br>
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdojodemos%2FCustomer-Service-Conversational-Insights%2Fmaster%2Finfrastructure%2FARM%2Faudio-template.json)

The Azure portal displays a pane that allows you to easily provide parameter values. The parameters are pre-filled with the default values from the template.

Once the deployment is completed, start processing your audio files by adding them in the "audio-input" container in the "storage account" in your "Resource Group". 
To navigate the Web Ui, check the "App Service" resource in your "Resource Group".


The template builds on top of the [Ingestion Client for Speech service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/ingestion-client).
Please check here for detailed parameters explainations: [Getting started with the Ingestion Client](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/blob/master/samples/ingestion/ingestion-client/Setup/guide.md)
